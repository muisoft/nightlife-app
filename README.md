# Night Coordination App
User stories:
>1. As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
>2. As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
>3. As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
>4. As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
Hint: Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
